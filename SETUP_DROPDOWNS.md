# Setting Up Database Research Dropdowns

## Your Current Setup (Works As-Is)
1. **Start server**: `python start_server.py`
2. **Open interface**: Open `chat_interface.html` in your browser
3. **Chat**: Uses your existing FastAPI server with streaming

## Enhanced Setup with Dropdowns

### Option 1: Use Enhanced HTML Interface (Recommended)
1. **Start server**: `python start_server.py` (same as before)
2. **Open enhanced interface**: Open `chat_interface_with_dropdowns.html` in your browser
3. **Enhanced features**:
   - Individual database dropdowns that auto-expand during querying
   - Real-time status updates (‚è≥ Pending, üîÑ Querying, ‚úÖ Complete, ‚ùå Error)
   - Better visual organization of research results
   - All your existing functionality preserved

### What's Different in the Enhanced Interface?

#### Visual Improvements:
- **Database dropdowns**: Each database query gets its own collapsible section
- **Status tracking**: Clear indicators showing which databases are being processed
- **Auto-expansion**: Dropdowns automatically open when actively streaming
- **Color coding**: Border colors change based on status (orange, blue, green, red)

#### Current Status Detection:
The enhanced interface automatically detects when your model returns database status blocks like:
```
**Database:** Earnings Call Transcripts
**Status:** ‚úÖ Found 15 relevant earnings calls...
```

And converts them into visual dropdowns with proper status indicators.

### How to Test

1. **Start your server**:
   ```bash
   python start_server.py
   ```

2. **Open the enhanced interface**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000` or open `chat_interface_with_dropdowns.html`

3. **Ask a research question**:
   ```
   "What are the latest trends in renewable energy investments?"
   ```

4. **Watch the dropdowns**:
   - Research plan appears first
   - Individual database dropdowns are created
   - Status updates as each database completes
   - Final summary at the bottom

### File Locations

- **Enhanced Interface**: `chat_interface_with_dropdowns.html`
- **Original Interface**: `chat_interface.html` (unchanged)
- **Server**: `start_server.py` (unchanged)
- **API**: `services/src/api.py` (unchanged)

### Backwards Compatibility

- Your existing server and API work without any changes
- Your original `chat_interface.html` still works exactly as before
- The enhanced interface is a drop-in replacement that adds dropdown functionality
- No changes needed to your model or backend code

### Future Enhancement Options

If you want even more advanced features, you could:

1. **Modify the model** to yield structured data (using `model_with_dropdowns.py`)
2. **Update the API** to stream database status events
3. **Add real-time progress bars** for each database query
4. **Include query timing metrics** in the dropdowns

But for now, the enhanced HTML interface provides the dropdown functionality you requested while keeping your existing server setup intact.

### Troubleshooting

- **Server not starting**: Check `python start_server.py` output for errors
- **Interface not loading**: Make sure you're accessing the correct HTML file
- **No dropdowns appearing**: The interface auto-detects research mode based on your model's output format
- **Dropdowns not updating**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

The enhanced interface automatically parses your existing model output and creates the dropdown UI in real-time.
