# AEGIS Chat App with Database Research Dropdowns

## Overview

The enhanced AEGIS chat application now displays individual database research results in real-time collapsible dropdowns. When each subagent is called during database research, it immediately generates a dropdown that streams the response as it's being processed.

## Files Created

### 1. **Enhanced Chat Interface** 
- `aegis_chat_app_enhanced.py` - Main chat app with dropdown support
- `aegis_chat_app_with_dropdowns.py` - Alternative implementation (simpler version)

### 2. **Enhanced Model**
- `aegis/src/chat_model/model_with_dropdowns.py` - Modified model that yields structured data for dropdowns

## Key Features

### Real-time Database Dropdowns
- Each database query gets its own collapsible dropdown
- Dropdowns show:
  - Database name in the title
  - Current status (Pending ‚è≥, Querying üîÑ, Complete ‚úÖ, Error ‚ùå)
  - Real-time streaming of subagent responses
- Dropdowns auto-expand when actively streaming
- Color-coded borders based on status

### Status Tracking
- **Pending (‚è≥ Orange)**: Database query queued but not started
- **Querying (üîÑ Blue)**: Subagent actively processing the query  
- **Complete (‚úÖ Green)**: Successful response received
- **Error (‚ùå Red)**: Query failed with error message

### Enhanced UI
- Research plan section shows selected databases
- Individual dropdown for each database result
- Summary section displays aggregated findings
- Maintains all original chat features (export, new chat, etc.)

## How It Works

### 1. Query Processing Flow
```
User Query ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Research Path ‚Üí Database Selection ‚Üí Parallel Queries
                                                              ‚Üì
                                     Create Dropdowns ‚Üê Planner Output
                                            ‚Üì
                              Update Each Dropdown as Results Complete
                                            ‚Üì
                                  Display Final Summary
```

### 2. Dropdown Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Dropdown created with "Pending" status when databases are selected
2. **Activation**: Status changes to "Querying" when subagent starts processing
3. **Streaming**: Real-time content updates as subagent generates response
4. **Completion**: Status changes to "Complete" or "Error" with final content

### 3. Data Structure
The enhanced model yields structured data:
```python
# Initialize all dropdowns
{
    "type": "database_dropdowns_init",
    "dropdowns": {
        "db_id_1": {
            "db_name": "internal_name",
            "display_name": "Human Readable Name",
            "status": "pending",
            "content": "",
            "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
        }
    }
}

# Update specific dropdown
{
    "type": "database_dropdown_update", 
    "db_id": "db_id_1",
    "status": "streaming",
    "content": "üîÑ Querying database..."
}
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running the Enhanced Chat App
```bash
# Run the enhanced version with dropdowns
python3 aegis_chat_app_enhanced.py

# Or run the alternative version
python3 aegis_chat_app_with_dropdowns.py
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:8052` (enhanced) or `http://localhost:8051` (alternative).

## Usage

### For Regular Queries
- Simple questions work the same as before
- Single response bubble with direct answer

### For Database Research Queries  
- Questions requiring database research automatically trigger dropdown interface
- Research plan shows which databases will be queried
- Each database gets its own dropdown that updates in real-time
- Click dropdown headers to expand/collapse individual results
- Summary section provides aggregated insights

### Example Research Query
"What are the latest trends in renewable energy investments?"

This would:
1. Show research plan with selected databases
2. Create dropdowns for each database (e.g., "Public Transcripts", "Benchmarking Data") 
3. Stream results into each dropdown as subagents complete
4. Display final summary with aggregated findings

## Technical Implementation

### Model Changes
- `model_with_dropdowns.py` extends the original model
- Yields both text content and structured dropdown data
- Tracks database query lifecycle and status
- Provides real-time updates as queries complete

### UI Changes  
- `format_messages()` function handles dropdown rendering
- `create_database_dropdown()` generates collapsible components
- Real-time callback updates dropdown content and status
- Enhanced styling with status-based color coding

### State Management
- `dropdowns-store` tracks all active dropdown states
- `current_dropdowns` global variable manages streaming updates
- Message IDs link dropdowns to specific assistant responses
- Automatic cleanup when starting new conversations

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see progress of individual database queries
2. **Transparency**: Clear indication of which databases are being searched
3. **Efficiency**: Users can start reading results from completed databases while others are still processing
4. **Organization**: Related results grouped by data source
5. **Status Awareness**: Clear visual feedback on query progress and completion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import Errors**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
- **Port Conflicts**: Apps run on different ports (8051, 8052) to avoid conflicts
- **Dropdown Not Updating**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to install all requirements

### Debug Mode
Both apps run with `debug=True` for development. Check terminal output for detailed error messages.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the dropdown functionality:
- Individual database query timing metrics
- Ability to re-run failed database queries
- Export individual database results
- Advanced filtering and search within dropdown content
- Database-specific error handling and retry logic
