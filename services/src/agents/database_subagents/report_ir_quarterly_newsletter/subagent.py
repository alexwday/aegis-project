"""
IR Quarterly Newsletter Subagent Module

This subagent handles queries for pre-generated quarterly newsletter reports.
These are specific reports that users can request by name, pulling already
generated quarterly summary data from PostgreSQL and formatting it for response.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER:
==================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER implementation for report retrieval.
When implementing the real subagent:

1. INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
   - query: Report request (e.g., "Q3 2024 quarterly newsletter for global banks")
   - scope: Usually "research" for reports
   - token: OAuth token for API access
   - process_monitor: Process tracking object
   - query_stage_name: Stage name for monitoring
   - research_statement: Optional context

2. DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   - Pre-generated quarterly newsletter reports in PostgreSQL
   - Organized by quarter, year, region, report type
   - Focus on global banks quarterly summary
   - Created based on IR team requirements for quarterly insights

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
   - Simple PostgreSQL query to retrieve pre-generated reports
   - No LLM analysis needed - just format and deliver
   - Focus on quarterly highlights and key developments
   - Format output for consistent newsletter presentation

4. RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
   - metadata scope: Available reports and metadata
   - research scope: Full formatted report content with quarterly summary
   - Include report generation date and newsletter parameters

PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR:
Returns demo quarterly newsletter reports for AEGIS testing.
