"""
RTS Database Subagent Module

This subagent handles queries to the Report to Shareholders (RTS) / 10-Q/10-K database
containing official regulatory filings used as secondary source for context and line items.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER:
==================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER implementation demonstrating the expected interface.
When implementing the real subagent:

1. INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
   - query: Search query (e.g., "BMO Q2 2024 regulatory filing ROE")
   - scope: "metadata" or "research"
   - token: OAuth token for API access
   - process_monitor: Process tracking object
   - query_stage_name: Stage name for monitoring  
   - research_statement: Optional research context

2. DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   - Contains RTS documents for Canadian banks
   - Contains 10-Q/10-K filings for US banks
   - Both raw numbers and contextual information
   - Used as SECONDARY source when primary sources lack data

3. RAG IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Connect to PostgreSQL using existing db patterns
   - Implement semantic search on RTS/10-Q/10-K content
   - Use LLM analysis for extracting relevant information
   - Focus on regulatory compliance and official statements

4. RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
   - metadata scope: Document listings with filing details
   - research scope: Analysis with official statements and figures
   - Include proper citations to specific filing sections

PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR:
Returns demo regulatory filing data for AEGIS testing.

## Regulatory Filing Analysis

Based on analysis of official regulatory filings (RTS/10-Q/10-K) for your query: "{query}"

### Official Financial Statements & Disclosures

**Bank of Montreal (Q2 2024 RTS)**:
- Official net income reported at $2.1B, up 5% year-over-year
- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio maintained at 15.2%
- Provision for credit losses totaled $387M, reflecting normalized credit environment
- Management discussion emphasized strong capital position and disciplined risk management

**JPMorgan Chase (Q2 2024 10-Q)**:
- Net interest income of $22.9B, down 3% from prior quarter due to deposit mix
- Trading revenue of $5.2B driven by strong client activity across asset classes
- Credit card charge-off rate of 3.1%, within expected range
- Regulatory capital ratios exceed well-capitalized thresholds

### Key Regulatory Themes

1. **Capital Adequacy**: Both institutions maintain strong capital buffers above regulatory minimums
2. **Risk Management**: Enhanced disclosures on credit risk modeling and stress testing
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Updates on Basel III implementation and regulatory changes
4. **Forward-Looking Statements**: Official guidance on economic outlook and strategic priorities

### Official Context & Compliance

The regulatory filings provide the official record of financial performance and regulatory compliance. Unlike earnings calls, these documents contain audited or reviewed financial statements with standardized disclosures required by regulators.

Key regulatory metrics and official statements are contained within these filings, making them the authoritative source for compliance-related inquiries and official financial positions.

**Note**: This analysis is based on PLACEHOLDER data. The actual implementation will query real RTS and 10-Q/10-K content from PostgreSQL and provide specific regulatory disclosures, official statements, and precise financial figures with proper section citations.
