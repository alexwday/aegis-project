"""
Report - CM Readthrough Subagent Module

This subagent handles queries for pre-generated Capital Markets (CM) readthrough reports.
These are specific reports that users can request by name, pulling already
generated CM-focused analysis data from PostgreSQL and formatting it for response.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER:
==================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER implementation for report retrieval.
When implementing the real subagent:

1. INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
   - query: Report request (e.g., "Q3 2024 CM readthrough for US banks")
   - scope: Usually "research" for reports
   - token: OAuth token for API access
   - process_monitor: Process tracking object
   - query_stage_name: Stage name for monitoring
   - research_statement: Optional context

2. DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   - Pre-generated CM readthrough reports in PostgreSQL
   - Organized by region, quarter, year, report type
   - Focus on US CM entities combined analysis
   - Created based on IR team requirements for CM sector insights

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
   - Simple PostgreSQL query to retrieve pre-generated reports
   - No LLM analysis needed - just format and deliver
   - Focus on CM-specific metrics and trading performance analysis
   - Format output for consistent presentation

4. RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
   - metadata scope: Available reports and metadata
   - research scope: Full formatted report content with CM analysis
   - Include report generation date and CM analysis parameters

PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR:
Returns demo CM readthrough reports for AEGIS testing.
