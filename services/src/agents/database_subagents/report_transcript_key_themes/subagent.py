"""
Report - Transcript Key Themes Subagent Module

This subagent handles queries for pre-generated transcript key themes reports.
These are specific reports that users can request by name, pulling already
generated thematic analysis data from PostgreSQL and formatting it for response.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER:
==================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER implementation for report retrieval.
When implementing the real subagent:

1. INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
   - query: Report request (e.g., "Key themes from Q3 2024 banking transcripts")
   - scope: Usually "research" for reports
   - token: OAuth token for API access
   - process_monitor: Process tracking object
   - query_stage_name: Stage name for monitoring
   - research_statement: Optional context

2. DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   - Pre-generated transcript key themes reports in PostgreSQL
   - Organized by bank, quarter, year, report type
   - Thematic analysis with topic clustering and sentiment
   - Created based on IR team requirements for thematic insights

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
   - Simple PostgreSQL query to retrieve pre-generated reports
   - No LLM analysis needed - just format and deliver
   - Focus on thematic grouping and key topic extraction
   - Format output for consistent presentation

4. RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
   - metadata scope: Available reports and metadata
   - research scope: Full formatted report content with themes
   - Include report generation date and thematic analysis parameters

PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR:
Returns demo transcript key themes reports for AEGIS testing.
