Transcripts Database Subagent Module

This subagent handles queries to the earnings call transcripts database containing
management discussion, guidance, context, and reasoning around financial results.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER:
==================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER implementation that demonstrates the expected interface and 
structure for the actual subagent. When implementing the real subagent:

1. INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE:
   - query: The search query string from the user
   - scope: Either "metadata" or "research" 
   - token: OAuth token for API access (if needed)
   - process_monitor: Object for tracking execution progress
   - query_stage_name: Stage name for process monitoring
   - research_statement: Optional research context for similarity search

2. EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
   - For scope="metadata": List[Dict] with document metadata
   - For scope="research": Dict with "detailed_research" and "status_summary" keys
   - Plus optional: doc_ids, file_links, page_refs, section_content, reference_index

3. DATABASE CONNECTION:
   - Use existing env_config.py for database credentials
   - Use SQLAlchemy patterns from initial_setup/db_config.py
   - Connect to PostgreSQL database containing transcript data

4. RAG IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Implement semantic search using embeddings
   - Filter documents based on research_statement if provided
   - Use LLM connector from llm_connectors/rbc_openai.py for analysis
   - Structure responses according to scope requirements

5. PROCESS MONITORING:
   - Log key steps using provided process_monitor
   - Track document IDs, file links, and other metadata
   - Update stage progress and errors appropriately

6. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Follow patterns from other agents (proper exception types)
   - Provide meaningful error messages in status_summary
   - Log errors without exposing sensitive information

PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR:
This implementation returns demo data for testing AEGIS agent capabilities.

## Earnings Call Transcript Analysis

Based on analysis of earnings call transcripts from the database, here are the key findings for your query: "{query}"

### Management Commentary & Guidance

**Royal Bank of Canada (Q3 2024)**:
- Management emphasized strong credit quality with provisions remaining below normalized levels
- CEO highlighted continued investment in digital transformation initiatives
- Guidance provided for Q4 expects stable net interest margins despite rate environment
- CFO noted capital ratios remain well above regulatory minimums

**TD Bank (Q3 2024)**:
- Leadership discussed successful retail banking growth strategy
- Management provided update on US market expansion plans and regulatory compliance
- Forward guidance suggests continued focus on efficiency improvements
- Discussion of competitive positioning in Canadian mortgage market

### Key Themes from Management Discussion

1. **Credit Environment**: Both banks emphasized proactive credit management
2. **Digital Strategy**: Continued investment in technology and customer experience
3. **Capital Management**: Strong capital positions supporting growth initiatives
4. **Regulatory Landscape**: Ongoing adaptation to regulatory requirements

### Context & Reasoning

Management commentary provides important context around the quantitative results, explaining the strategic decisions and market factors influencing performance. The transcript analysis reveals management's confidence in current positioning while acknowledging economic uncertainties.

**Note**: This analysis is based on PLACEHOLDER data. The actual implementation will query real earnings call transcript content from the PostgreSQL database and provide specific quotes, citations, and detailed management commentary based on your search criteria.
